# Modal Game Gallery

Welcome to the **Modal Game Gallery**, a collection of interactive and fun games built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project showcases several classic and exciting games, each presented in a modal-like interface for an engaging experience. The games are displayed in rows of three, making it easy to navigate through and enjoy.

## Live Demo

You can play the games live on [Netlify](https://modal-game-gallery.netlify.app/).

## Games Included

### 1. **Guess the Number Game**

In this game, the user has **20 chances** to guess the correct number, which is randomly generated by the machine between **1 and 20**. After each guess, the game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game ends when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.

### 2. **Tic Tac Toe**

This is the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game where two players alternate placing "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. The game also includes a reset button to start a new game after the winner is declared.

### 3. **Stop the Ball**

In this game, a ball floats within a designated area in the modal. The user can click the **Stop** button to freeze the ball at its current position. The ball will resume its motion when the user clicks the **Resume** button. This creates an interactive and fun challenge for the player to control the ball's movement.

### 4. **Hangman**

A classic word-guessing game where the user has to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. The game ends when the user either guesses the word or the entire hangman figure is drawn.

### 5. **Alarm Clock**

This game functions as a simple **alarm clock**. The user can set an alarm by choosing the time, and once the set time arrives, an alarm sound will play to notify the user. This game is perfect for simulating a basic alarm system.

### 6. **Calculator**

A basic **Calculator** app that allows users to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The simple and clean interface provides a seamless experience for quick calculations.
